# Udemy docker and k8 course



## Section 1

**Docker how it works**:

the __docker run__ command looks like local images first and if it canâ€™t find them, looks to docker hub.

Docker makes use of a container, which you think of as a allocated amount of system reosurces devoted to a process or set of process.

The kernel looks at the system call and looks at the calling application and directs it to a segment of the computer resources. Called namespacing. Namespacing allows you to devote hardware resource to a the calling process. It isolates resources per process.

A control group can limit the amount of hard resources a process can use. It can limit how much cpu and memory a process can use. even network bandwidth.

control group and namespacing together can really affect processes. A container from docker utilizes both of these. a container is a grouping of processes that have a grouping of resources assigned to it.

hello
The kernel is repsonsible for looking at the process system call and directing it to the necessary resources.

this is what happens when you run docker run.

# Section X

## Notes


## New commands
instead of pasting an id everytime, use and ID.

```
docker build -t jwan/redis:latest .
```
- the trailing . is the build context for `build` command... source of all files and folders to be used to build container out.
-the above command tags an image. now we can run it using the tag.

```
docker build -t jwan/redis:latest
```
## New Dockerfile commands






# Section 4

the : specifies an image tag:

```
FROM node:alpine

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

"alpine" is a tag, not a repository in this case. alpine means the most bare version of a repo, small and compact as possible. no preinstalled programs like git or text editing.

If you have extra files that need to be stored in the container, you have to move them there yourself.
For ex, package.json file has to be moved into the container if your docker command or RUN is npm install. So add this to your Dockerfile using the COPY commmand:

```
FROM node:alpine

# Install some dependencies
COPY ./ ./
RUN npm install

# default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```


## Notes

#### setup port mapping
- specified during runtime during the run command.
if anyone makes an incoming local network request to some port inside container:
- containers can reach out (clearly because it can install) but traffic into the container is limited.

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 <image_name_or_id>
```

port forwarding command
![port_mapping1](images/section_4/port_mapping1.png)

This is conceptually what the run command is doing:


![images/section_4/port_mapping](images/section_4/port_mapping.png)

- the second number is the port inside the container. first number is localhost.
- ports can also be different.


#### prevent unnecessary rebuilds:
```
FROM node:alpine

# makes future commands relative to this folder
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Install some dependencies
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY ./ ./

# default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

the COPY command looks at local package.json specified by the build context argument of `docker run` and copies them over to the WORKDIR.
- by splitting copy up into two commands, any changes to index.js will only bust cache of second COPY and npm install will not run again unless the package.json changes.


## Section 4 commands

runs a shell after running an image:
```
docker run -it <image_name> sh
```


-to run a second command inside a process, in this case a sh shell: (-it is for interactive)
```
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
```

## Section 4 new Dockerfile commands
WORKDIR - any future commands in dockerfile will be relative to this folder that we specify. So maybe we don't put copy our files into the root directory of the container.
-workdir also affects commands that affect the container issued through command line like docker exec -it <container_id> sh... it sh's into the folder. It affects commands that are exectued through the `exec` command.

```
FROM node:alpine

# makes future commands relative to this folder
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Install some dependencies
COPY ./ ./
RUN npm install

# default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
